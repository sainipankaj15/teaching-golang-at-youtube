# GoLang Learning Series

This repository contains a collection of Go (Golang) code examples and mini-projects, each demonstrating a fundamental concept in the Go programming language. The code is organized by topic, and each folder contains a self-contained Go program. This series is inspired by the [GoLang YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLI1J90OGORr9NFeUkBlEyn7AWjg5o28DM).

## Folder Descriptions

### array_and_slices
Demonstrates how to declare, initialize, and iterate over arrays and slices in Go.

### channel
Shows how to use channels for communication between goroutines.

### for_loop
Examples of using `for` loops to iterate over slices and arrays.

### function
Defines and calls functions, including returning values and handling errors.

### goroutine-learning
Illustrates the use of goroutines for concurrent execution, including running functions concurrently and using `time.Sleep` to synchronize.

### if_else
Basic usage of `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements for conditional logic.

### map
Demonstrates the creation and usage of maps (dictionaries) in Go.

### mutex
Shows how to use mutexes (`sync.Mutex` and `sync.RWMutex`) to safely share data between goroutines.

### struct
Defines and uses structs to group related data together.

### variable-declare
Covers different ways to declare and initialize variables in Go.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have [Go installed](https://golang.org/doc/install).
2. Navigate to any folder and run the example:
   ```sh
   cd folder_name
   go run main.go
   ```
